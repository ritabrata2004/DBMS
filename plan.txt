I'll update the implementation plan based on your clarifications:

Updated Implementation Plan for Database Connection & Metadata Management
Part 1: Database Models and Constants (in databases app)
Define database type constants (PostgreSQL)
Define connection status constants (connected, disconnected, error)
Implement ClientDatabase, TableMetadata, ColumnMetadata, and RelationshipMetadata models
Set up appropriate foreign key relationships
Part 2: Database Connection Service (in databases app)
Create a basic DatabaseConnector service with PostgreSQL support
Implement connection testing methods for database types
Create simple query execution methods with proper error handling
Implement connection status tracking (connected when in use, disconnected when idle)
Part 3: Metadata Extraction (in databases app)
Create PostgreSQL schema introspection using information_schema
Implement a unified metadata extraction interface for database types
Add extraction methods for tables, columns, and relationships
Part 4: Metadata Processing for RAG (in databases app)
Set up the MetadataVectorizer service structure
Create skeleton for table and column description generators
Set up placeholder for vector embedding generation
Prepare metadata caching mechanism structure
Part 5: API Endpoints and Views (in databases app)
Create DatabaseViewSet for CRUD operations on database connections
Add connection testing endpoint
Implement metadata update endpoints
Create read-only endpoints for schema access
Part 6: Serializers (in databases app)
Create serializers for ClientDatabase model
Implement serializers for metadata models
Add specialized serializers for the API responses
Part 7: URLs and Routing (in databases app)
Define URL patterns for database endpoints
Register ViewSets with routers
Connect to the main URL configuration
Part 8: User Integration (in user app)
Add database ownership relationship with existing User model
Set up permissive access controls for testing
Part 9: Project Configuration (in main backend app)
Register the databases app in Django settings
Add any required third-party packages to requirements.txt
Configure permissions to allow all for development/testing
This plan follows your existing backend structure and focuses on creating the basic structure with placeholder functions that can be filled in later. All database connection and metadata-related code will be in the databases app, with minimal integration with the user app for ownership.
